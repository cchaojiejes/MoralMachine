# MoralMachine
(Melbourne University COMP90041 Final Project)

The idea of Moral Machines is based on the Trolley Dilemma, a fictional scenario presenting a decision maker with a moral dilemma: choosing ”the lesser of two evils”. 

The scenario entails an autonomous car whose brakes fail at a pedestrian crossing. 
As it is too late to relinquish control to the car’s passengers, the car needs to make a decision based on the facts 
available about the situation.

Ethical Engine is a program designed to explore different scenarios, 
with an algorithm to decide between the life of the car’s passengers vs. the life of the pedestrians. You can audit your decision-making 
algorithm through simulations, and allow users of your program to judge the outcomes themselves.
